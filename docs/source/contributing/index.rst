Contributing
============

We welcome pull requests that improve the editor, webapp, documentation, or
tooling. Before submitting changes, review the repository-wide guidelines in
``CONTRIBUTING.md`` and the Code of Conduct in ``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md``.

Core expectations
-----------------

* Align with the existing TypeScript + React stack and the linting rules
  configured in each package.
* Keep documentation accurate. Significant feature work should update both the
  code and the relevant Sphinx pages.
* Write readable, well-tested code. Add or update unit/interaction tests when
  touching core logic, reducers, or utilities.
* Provide clear commit messages and keep pull requests focused on a single
  theme.

When in doubt, open an issue or discussion on GitHub to scope the work before
coding. The maintainers are responsive and prefer early alignment to late
rework.

Next steps
----------

* :doc:`development-workflow` lists the scripts and checks you should run before
  opening a pull request.
* Review ``GOVERNANCE.md`` for the project's decision-making process.
